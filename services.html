<h1>Youth Programs / የወጣቶች አገልግሎት​​</h1>

<p>St. Mary's Sunday School has always been the main focus of our Church's interest. The Church plays its biggest role by providing Amharic language, religious, historical and cultural - oriented classes thru its (Sunbeth School) programs to young Ethiopians born in the U.S.A. The School is run and administered by volunteer teachers who are active members of the Church. So far there are over 95 registered students and only half of the total number of students are benefiting from this invaluable service by attending classes regularly. We hope to expand and strengthen our programs in the future by enrolling more students and acquiring more facilities. We also urge parents to be actively involved in showing interest in their kids' education as well as forming a partnership with the teachers for mutual growth and development in all areas. Our aim is to build morally, culturally and spiritually strong members of the community. We will post more detailed information about our school in the future. And thanks for visiting our web page. Your comments are always welcome.

    <h1>BAPTISM</h1>
    <p>Of the seven sacraments, Baptism is the first. Baptism is the sacrament through which we are reborn and enter the Kingdom of God (Jn 3:5). Baptism has a Biblical basis (Mt. 28:19). Through Baptism sin is forgiven (Acts 2:8). Cleansing and blessing is attained through Baptism (1pet. 3:21; Tit. 3:5). Baptism means to be born again from the Holy Spirit. Our Lord Jesus Christ founded baptism. At the time when Jesus Christ was to be baptized, heaven was opened, and the mystery revealed (John 3:3) (Mathews 3:16). By accepting this truth, our Church baptizes people in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holly Spirit in order to make them Children of Jesus Christ. In the book of Mathew, Jesus Christ told his disciples to go and baptize all the people in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holly Spirit and make them his disciples (Mathew 28:19). For this reason, the Church baptizes everyone and makes him or her true Child of God. Boys have to be baptized on the 40th day of their birth while girls have to be baptized on the 80th day (Leviticus 12).</p>
    <h1>Holy Matrimony/Marriage</h1>

        <h4>Marriage is a public sign that one gives oneself totally to this other person.</h4>
        <p>Marriage is a public sign that one gives oneself totally to this other person. It is also a public statement about God: the loving union of husband and wife speaks of family values and also God’s values. God is active in our lives and joins a man and a woman in a relationship of mutual love. Through this Sacrament, a man and a woman are publicly joined as husband and wife. They enter into a new relationship with each other, God, and the Church. In Orthodox teachings, Marriage is not simply a social institution, it is an eternal vocation of the kingdom. A husband and wife are called by the Holy Spirit not only to live together, but also to share their Christian life together so that each, with the aid of the other, may grow closer to God and become the persons they are meant to be. In the Orthodox Marriage Service, after the couple have been betrothed and exchanged rings, they are crowned with “crowns of glory and honor” signifying the establishment of a new family under God.

        </p>
    <h1>HOLY COMMUNION</h1>
    <p>Holy Communion is the culmination of all sacraments of the Church. Holy Communion means offering of sacrifice. This is not an offering of man to God, but the offering of God for man. The sheep and goats were offered as sacrifices in the altars during the times of the Old Testament. These were examples preceding the offering of the flesh and blood of Christ during the New Testament. The offering of bread and cup of grace that Melchizedek offered to Abraham (Gen. 14:18) and the sacrifices that the Israelites offered during the day of their liberation exemplify Christ our pascal lamb. Holy Communion has Biblical foundation (Mt. 26:26; 1Cor. 11:23-25). When the priest puts the bread on the paten and the wine in the chalice and conducts liturgical prayer, the bread is changed into the body of the Son of God and the wine into the blood of the Son of God. What is thus given in our Church is the body and blood of the Son of God.

        <h1>ORDINATION</h1>
        <p>This is the sacrament through which the clergy are entitled to perform the various spiritual services of the Church and it has Biblical basis (Mt. 28:19,20; Eph. 4:11; Acts 26:20).</p>
        
        <h1>HOLY MATRIMONY</h1>
        <p>Christian marriage is one of the seven sacraments, which is performed in a church by means of which the grace of the Holy Spirit is obtained. Holy Matrimony is based on the Bible (Gen. 1:27, 28,2:18; Mt. 19:4-6).

        </p>
        
        <h1>MYSTERY OF PENANCE</h1>
       <p>Penance means to feel remorse, repent and cleanse oneself from sin. Although Christians are reborn through Baptism, human beings are liable to commit sins. Therefore, every Christian should have a father confessor (Nesha Abbat). Each one should go to the father confessor and confess his/her sins. (Lev. 14:31, Mt. 8:4; Epiphanius Faith of Fathers Haimanot Abew 59:20). Those who confess their sins and return to God receive the grace of God and by receiving the Holy Communion they will enter to their former place of honor.</p>
        
       <h1>UNCTION OF THE SICK</h1> 
       <p> Unction of the sick is the Sacrament through which the priest anoints the body of the sick asking for divine grace to cure both body and soul. It is not an ordinary means of healing diseases and the healing power is not attributed to the oil but to the prayer. St. James mentions this Sacrament in his Epistle (Jas. 5:13-15, Mk. 6:13).
        Each of the Seven Sacraments has its own book of prayer and system of application. The Seven Sacraments as a whole are considered as manifestations of the faith and tenets of the religion of the Church.</p>
